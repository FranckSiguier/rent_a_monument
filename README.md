## Rent a monument

Rent a monument is a web application (designed for Desktop primarily but with responsiveness) that is a mockup of Airbnb where you can Rent famous monuments of the world.
This project was an end of bootcamp project. We worked as a team of three but we all implemented features related to front end development (HTML erb, CSS, JavaScript libraries) and related to back-end development (ruby). We used Heroku to deploy the app, with a PostgreSQL database and we used cloudinary to host pictures to be displayed in the app.
